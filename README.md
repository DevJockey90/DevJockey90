Hello, I'm Landen. 
I worked in the automotive industry for 7 years as a quality inspector. But there was something missing, I didn't feel that I was meeting my full potential and exercising my creativity. I started coding to open my creative channels, and eventually leaned into freelancing. After freelancing for years I want to join a product team that has established clients that love the product. I'm ready to be apart of something that's bigger than my wildest dreams. I'm ready to tap into my full potential, thanks for joining me on the journey.
