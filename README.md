Hello, Im Landen a Self-Taught Software Developer/Engineer who loves everything in Tech. I want to go further than just websites and apps as I am interested in AI & ML, Data and alot more.
Using languages such as HMTL, CSS, Javascript I build and deploy Responsive Websites and code random things that interest me. Outside of coding I enjoy sports, fpv drones, and I Dj as well.
Looking foward to meeting and linking up with some amazing coders on here and possibly do some collab work in the future.
